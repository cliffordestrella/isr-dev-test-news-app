# isr-dev-test-news-app

==> For this test I used these tools since I'm comfortable with these especially for projects more on functionalities and backend. These list of tools are best use or compatability with PHP as the programming language. Also, since I've been more experienced with them.

Thus, I proceed with the frameworks I'm comfortable and more experience considering the time limit.


*PHP - language
*MYSQL - SQL
PHPMYADMIN - Database
*XAMPP - Server


NOTE: I aim the showcase the CRUD to be applied, not much with the design :)
